		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

		<p><a href="http://www.floriantessloff.com">www.floriantessloff.com</a> and <a href="http://ericwhitacre.com">www.ericwhitacre.com</a></p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>

		<p>I think I am most intrigued by the use of space in these two websites. The layouts are inherently balanced, to me, because there is no competition for eyeballs across columns of information. Each content area takes up the entire horizontal space of the screen, so the reader can focus on just one thing at a time. Since this is meant to be for a composer, I would argue that the act of listening to music should be an all-encompassing experience, one which allows the listener to focus on just the music, nothing else.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

		<p>The two websites are quite similar in their layout, although ericwhitacre.com has more content to deal with. I hope that this type of layout would allow for the easy addition of content as it becomes available, since (I am assuming) a client seldom knows exactly what he or she wants on the first go-around.</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

		<ul>
  		<li><strong>Home</strong></li>
  		<img src="home.jpg" alt="Home">
  		<p>The focal point of this page will be an image, either of the composer himself or an image that inspires him. The toolbar along the top and the streaming music bar along the bottom (which will float across every page, although will not play until clicked) help to create a balanced area which seems separate from the rest of the site, but is ultimately just one part of the whole.</p>
  		<li><strong>About</strong></li>
  		<img src="about.jpg" alt="About">
		<p>The focal point of this page will probably be the three photos along the bottom, although the block of text above the photos, I imagine, will be a close second. The text will be centered in the space, so the three photos will balance and ground the content.</p>
 		<li><strong>Music</strong></li>
 		<img src="music.jpg" alt="Music">
		<p>This page I am a bit less sure of, since I do not know exactly how much content we will have here. I basically copied this directly from floriantessloff.com because I thought it was interesting looking and the blocks of images gave the music some weight.</p>
 		<li><strong>News and Events</strong></li>
 		<img src="news_and_events.jpg" alt="News and Events">
 		<p>I assume the focal point here will be the center block, and considering that Facebook is like the most popular social media site of all time or whatever, that seems fitting. I would like for the Facebook and Twitter blocks to be basically a feed of whatever content is most recent.</p>
 		<li><strong>Contact</strong></li>
 		<img src="contact.jpg" alt="Contact">
 		<p>This page is pretty boring, just centered text, so the focal point will be the only thing on the page.</p>
		</ul>
